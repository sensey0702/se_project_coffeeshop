# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Layouts could be improved. They match the project brief but I am sure there are better ways I could have achieved it. I would love to add an online ordering form in the future. It would be really cool to add a fixed position coffee cup in the bottom right corner that you click on to take you to online ordering. There could be a steam animation on it and you could do a scale tranformation when you hover over it. Attached is a screen shot of the current finished project.
